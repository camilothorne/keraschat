# keraschat

A Keras-based implementation of a DL model that combines CCNs, LSTMs and GloVe embeddings to classify developer descriptions as either senior level or non-senior (mid-level, entry-level) programmers. It relies on Keras, Scikitlearn and Tensorflow.

GloVe embeddings must be downloaded separately. Also, some system paths need to be modified to train and test the model. A small training/test set of ~200 examples is provided.
